Feedback for Jerilyn Calaor

I'm pretty sure you have the files in the LTDR, as we discussed. But I think it would be useful to have a readme file here with a note
saying where the files that you're using are in the LTDR. For the purposes of the class, it would be helpful if you saved the individual raw data files
and the data wrangling script and the tidy script on here too. Do most of the work on LTDR - that's the official location for all of this,
But save the files here so i can give feedback the same way I give it to the rest of the group. When you're done, we'll delete this repository, 
and just use the LTDR, so make sure everything is updated on there. Does that make sense? Thanks!
